# MIRGE tutorial at NUWEST 2024

[NUWEST: NNSA-University Workshop on Exascale Simulation Technologies](https://illinois-ceesd.github.io/nuwest/)

## Disclaimer

This material is, as of this writing (December 1, 2023) largely unchanged from
what was used for a dry run of the Illinois aspects of NUWEST at NCSA in the
fall of 2023. It should be viewed as, perhaps, a general indication of the format
(which we viewed as generally successful), but the detailed content may very
well change, even substantially.
